food_001,,"Interview with Betty Fussell, Part 1",Betty Fussell; Judith Weinraub,2010-03-24,"The distinguished historian Betty Fussell was one of the first American writers to focus on food as a legitimate subject of scientific, social, and anthropological inquiry.
In her 1999, The Story of Corn: the Myths and History, the Culture and Agriculture, the Art and Science of America's Quintessential Crop, Fussel used the history of corn to tell a distinctly American story. She also created a genre, now much imitated by other writers, focused on a single foodstuff.
Born in 1927 in California and reared there, she has made her home in New York's Greenwich Village for decades. She lives around the corner from James Beard's cooking school run out of his home. Her only contact was a week's worth of classes there, but they share an abiding passion for American food.
Her essays in literary journals, major newspapers, national magazines and encyclopedias are written with a grace few food writers can match. She also lectures at museums, universities, state fairs, corn festivals, historical societies and culinary groups. In 1999, her food memoir, My Kitchen Wars, traced her life from her childhoood through her marriage to a college sweetheart, her travails as an academic wife, her own academic career, the women's movement, and her wider success when she found her essential subject: food.

She unequivocally transformed the field when, in 1988, she took over the Department of Home Economics and Nutrition at New York University, and soon turned it into a ground-breaking academic program in nutrition, food studies, and public health
Her path traces a childhood without much parental encouragement, academic successes and multiple degrees, a pre-second wave feminism early career filled with the common restrictions and frustrations women then faced, and an adulthood at the highest rank of academic and personal achievement.
A much sought-after speaker with particular interests in food politics, food marketing, and nutrition, she has written five books, and balances a schedule that includes teaching; research and writing; speaking; and an active highly-read blog (www.foodpolitics.com).
This interview covers her early life and education; her two marriages; the challenges of balancing motherhood and a career; the responsibilities and challenges she faced writing the 1988 Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health; her books; her years at New York University; and the development of the University's Food Studies Department.","Authorship; Sex roles; Nutrition; Feminism; Food security; Junk food; Health; Food adulteration and inspection; Food industry and trade; Farm produce -- Marketing -- Government policy; Urban agriculture; Women in higher education; Public Health; Children -- Nutrition; Editing; Diet; Pet food industry; Agriculture and state; Agricultural processing industries; United States.

Already a highly respected and well-reviewed chef and restaurateur when he became the head judge of the wildly popular television program Top Chef, Colicchio is probably the best-known chef in America.
As a young teenager, he started cooking at home, discovered he enjoyed it and worked his way through a swim club food concession, a Burger King, and increasingly more ambitious restaurants in his native New Jersey before heading to Manhattan. His teachers were his on-the-jobs training, the chefs he worked for there and in New York and books, especially Jacques Pepin's on method and technique.
He came to wide attention at the Gramercy Tavern in New York's Flatiron district, and then at Craft nearby.
The recipient of five James Beard Foundation awards, today Colichio and his cooking can be seen not only at the Craft restaurants (including Craftbar and Craftsteak) in New York, LA, Dallas, and Las Vegas), but also at Colicchio and Sons in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. In 2003, Colicchio and two partners founded the more affordable sandwich and salad outlets, 'wichcraft.
